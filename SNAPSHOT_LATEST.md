## WHAT'S NEXT (Priority Queue)

1. **T40 mechanical damper** — servo tracking confirmed working, user tuning physically. No firmware change needed.
2. **Pure Pi4-local STT commands** — deferred from S110. Evaluate simple wakeword-only commands ("hey jarvis… go to sleep") handled by Pi4 Whisper without LLM, for cases where GandalfAI is asleep. Design session needed.
3. **Wake-from-sleep fall-through** — still deferred. Current: wakeword during sleep → quip → re-sleep. Evaluate whether it should fall through to active listening after the quip.

## Machine Status

| System | Status |
|---|---|
| Pi4 192.168.1.200 | Operational. assistant.service active. ttyIRIS_EYES → ttyACM0 (serial 13625440, T41). udev corrected + SD persisted S97. |
| GandalfAI 192.168.1.3 | **OPERATIONAL.** iris/iris-kids on **mistral-small3.2:24b** (S119, was qwen3.5:27b). Ollama **0.30.7**. arch=`mistral3`, 24.0B, caps include `vision` (Pixtral baked in, no mmproj). 15GB Q4, **100% GPU** confirmed (no CPU offload). **num_ctx 6144 unified (S119b)** so text+vision share one context — no reload. Text ~42 tok/s; vision cold-after-text **2.4s** (load 0.28s), warm 1.6s/0.3s first-token (vs 29s on qwen3.5). PT-001 15/20, persona-locked, no token bleed. Env (Machine scope): FLASH_ATTENTION=1, NUM_PARALLEL=1, KV_CACHE=q8_0. Kokoro TTS 8004 OK. **Clone `C:\IRIS\IRIS-Robot-Face` reset to S123/9a7f879 (S124, was S115/1a6950b + dirty modelfile edits).** **Watchtower scoped (S124):** `--label-enable` active; kokoro-tts, wyoming-whisper, wyoming-piper protected from auto-update; open-webui + watchtower labeled for auto-update. **Reboot hardened S127:** IRIS_DockerAutoStart schtask (AtLogon/gandalf/Highest) auto-starts both compose stacks. Docker Desktop auto-starts via HKCU Run. No manual action needed on reboot. |
| Teensy 4.1 (eyes+mouth) | **FLASHED S101.** [VER] confirmed `firmware=S101 built=Jun 7 2026`. Bridge live, no DROPs. Mouth update rate 2Hz during TTS (eye jitter fix). **Sleep mouth fixed S128:** sleep backlight now `MOUTH_INTENSITY:5` (BL_MAP[5]≈6%, starfield visible) — live config was overriding to 1 (≈0.8%, appeared blank). No firmware change. |
| Teensy 4.0 (servo+gesture) | **FLASHED S97** (FACE_RETURN_MS 30000ms). Tracking confirmed working. Mechanical damper tuning ongoing. |
| TTS | Kokoro primary (Docker 8004), Piper fallback (Wyoming 10200). **Streaming dispatch live (S116):** main LLM replies synthesized per sentence and played overlapped. **Hardened S122:** STOP now halts producer dispatch within ~1 sentence (shared interrupt event); TTS_MAX_CHARS enforced cumulatively across the utterance. **Unified S126:** follow-up turns use the same streaming pipeline via shared `_speak_llm_turn()` — first audio ~1.0–1.3 s after follow-up llm_start (was blocked for full generation + synthesis); follow-up turns now bench-logged (route=FOLLOWUP). |

## Active Issues

- **LOW: Wake-from-sleep fall-through** — wakeword during sleep: IRIS wakes, plays quip, re-enters sleep (S104). Evaluate whether it should fall through to active listening instead of re-sleeping.
- **LOW: Ollama version pin** — Currently 0.30.7 (runs mistral-small3.2:24b fine). Firewall outbound block on ollama app.exe in place; user unchecked auto-update in Ollama UI (S110). The qwen3.5 pin rationale is moot post-S119, but keep the firewall/pin to avoid surprise upgrades.
- **RESOLVED (S128): evening sleep mode now fully sleeps the displays.** Mouth was blank because live `iris_config.json` forced `MOUTH_INTENSITY_SLEEP=1` (≈0.8% backlight, starfield invisible) → raised to 5. Eyes could stay awake on state desync because voice `EYES_SLEEP`/`EYES_WAKE` were guarded by the in-memory `state.eyes_sleeping` → now route unconditionally through `_do_sleep()`/`_do_wake()`, plus a startup reconcile re-asserts sleep when booting/restarting inside the sleep window. DEPLOYED + VERIFIED (full 21:00 path exercises tonight).
- **RESOLVED (S119b): iris/iris-kids modelfile `num_ctx` raised 4096 → 6144.** Text+vision now share one context — Ollama no longer reloads on text↔vision switches (vision cold-after-text 12.4s → 2.4s) and generation has real headroom vs the ~3700-tok system prompt. VRAM verified safe: `ollama ps` = 15GB at 6144, +Kokoro 2GB = 17/24 GB, 100% GPU. The old sysmap `num_ctx ≤ 4096` limit was gemma3/qwen-era (obsolete) and is updated.

## udev Serial Numbers — Confirmed S97

| Symlink | Serial | Device |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev/ttyIRIS_EYES` | `13625440` | Teensy 4.1 (eyes + TFT mouth) |
| `/dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO` | `12763490` | Teensy 4.0 (servo + gesture) |

S94b had these swapped. Corrected S97 by connecting T41 alone and observing which serial appeared. IRIS_ARCH.md, pi4/scripts/99-iris-teensy.rules, and live Pi4 udev rules all updated.

## Do Not Touch

- `iris_config.json` — gesture map + emotion map live config
- `alsa-init.sh`
- `src/TeensyEyes.ino`
- `src/eyes/EyeController.h`

## Last Session Changes (S128 — 2026-06-11)

- **Evening sleep-mode display fix + scheduled-sleep hardening — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED (Pi4). No firmware change.** Full diagnosis: `docs/sleep_mode_diagnosis_S128.md`.
- **Blank mouth (root cause):** live `iris_config.json` overrode `MOUTH_INTENSITY_SLEEP=1` → firmware `BL_MAP[1]=2/255≈0.8%`; the starfield was rendering but invisible. Raised to **5** (= the firmware's own `mouthSetSleepIntensity()` BL_MAP[5], matches repo `config.py` default).
- **Eyes stay awake (root cause):** `state.eyes_sleeping` is in-memory, defaults False, never seeded; voice `EYES_SLEEP`/`EYES_WAKE` were guarded by it so a desync (e.g. an assistant restart inside the sleep window) made "go to sleep" a silent no-op. Now both route through authoritative `_do_sleep()`/`_do_wake()` (unconditional/idempotent), and a **startup reconcile** re-asserts sleep when `in_sleep_window()` OR `/tmp/iris_sleep_mode`. Firmware needs no change — its render loop is gated on `eyesSleeping`, so it's self-consistent.
- **Goodnight chime:** `iris_sleep.py` called a non-existent `/usr/local/bin/piper` (errored nightly) → now plays an optional, network-free `/home/pi/sounds/goodnight.wav` (skips silently if absent).
- **Cron version-controlled:** added `pi4/scripts/iris_cron_reference.txt` (the `pi` user crontab sleep/wake/backup entries; confirmed SD-persisted).
- **Deployed (md5 RAM=SD):** assistant.py=`2092e0a8baa7e1bf0091c643436fdfec`, iris_sleep.py=`d697798794ca50f544321aa7288f7106`, iris_config.json=`bb5c803b0e7a8298e95869bfe27f71f0`. POST **20/23 PASS, 0 FAIL → AUTHORIZED**. Functional test: EYES:SLEEP → `MOUTH_INTENSITY: 5` + `starfield starting`; EYES:WAKE → restored.
- **Pending human check:** confirm tonight's automatic 21:00 sleep — mouth shows visible starfield, eyes show starfield; wake-word after that wakes then re-sleeps.

## Last Session Changes (S126 — 2026-06-11)

- **Follow-up loop unified onto the S116 streaming pipeline — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED (harness-level).** New shared `_speak_llm_turn()` in `pi4/assistant.py` drives BOTH the main turn and follow-up LLM turns: `stream_ollama` → per-sentence `synthesize` (Kokoro→Piper) → overlapped `play_pcm_stream`, emotion-on-first-chunk, STOP per chunk + post-synthesize, cumulative TTS_MAX_CHARS, producer-owned `_stop_playback`, history trim at 20, `t_last_spoke`. Follow-up answers now start speaking on the first sentence (~1.0–1.3 s after llm_start; previously blocked for full generation + full synthesis). Follow-up time/volume fast-paths and hallucination/dismissal/STOP gates unchanged.
- **Follow-up turns now bench-logged:** journal `[BENCH]` stages `fu_`-prefixed (keeps `/api/bench` journal parser from overwriting main-turn stages within a wake cycle); `iris_bench.jsonl` gets a `route="FOLLOWUP"` record per turn with stt/llm/tts/play stages.
- **Blocking `ask_ollama()` retired** (no callers left — vision uses `ask_vision()`); dead imports removed; `services/llm.py` docstring + `IRIS_ARCH.md` source map updated.
- **Verified via live Pi4 harness on the deployed modules** (real stream_ollama + Kokoro + play_pcm_stream through the speaker): follow-up first audio 1250/1046 ms; STOP at t+3.0 s mid-MAX-story → dispatch halted at 3.21 s, stream abandoned; interrupt propagated player→producer→caller; JSONL FOLLOWUP records present. POST after restart: **20/23 PASS, 3 WARN, 0 FAIL → AUTHORIZED**, `[INFO] Ready.`
- **Deployed (md5 RAM=SD):** assistant.py=`f48e258fdf86f3ef4c7bf4ceb5ca0bf0`, services/llm.py=`bc0e4bae31e616227840581a98adb7d4`.
- **Pending human check:** real spoken follow-up through the mic + spoken "stop" mid-follow-up.
- **Side-finding (pre-existing):** interrupt-listener STT substring-matches STOP_PHRASES — IRIS saying "…stops…" can self-interrupt when speaker bleed exceeds the detect threshold; bleed peaked 25733 > LOUD_STOP_THRESHOLD=25000 in harness conditions. See HANDOFF Proactive Flags.

## Previous Session Changes (S123 — 2026-06-11)

- **Gesture MUTE fixed — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.** `set_volume()` clamped to VOL_MIN=60 so MUTE landed at ~47% and the `get_volume()==0` unmute branch was unreachable. Now: `set_volume(level, allow_zero=True)` bypasses the floor for MUTE only; bridge tracks `_muted` state explicitly and second CW restores `_mute_restore`. Live check on real ALSA: 123 → `Playback 0 [0%]` → restored 123.
- **RIGHT gesture wired — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.** Firmware emits `RIGHT` (right swipe) but no map had the key → SKIP. `"RIGHT": "STOP"` added to both default maps (bridge + iris_web); bridge `_load_gesture_map()` now merges stored config over defaults so RIGHT works with the existing stored GESTURE_MAP (iris_config.json untouched). Web Gestures tab has a RIGHT row; `/api/gesture_config` returns RIGHT:STOP. Physical-swipe log check pending human.
- **Router word-boundary polish — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.** `_layer0_reflex` prefix matches now require exact-or-phrase+space ("stopwatch please"→LLM, "cancelled order"→LLM; "stop"/"cancel"/"stop talking now" still REFLEX/STOP — confirmed in live iris_intent.log).
- **Cleanups:** assistant.py RMS gate uses `SILENCE_RMS` (was hardcoded 300); `handle_volume_command` calls `get_volume()` lazily (saves 2 subprocesses on non-matches); `play_pcm_speaking` docstring 120ms→0.50s; dead `GESTURE_SENSOR_REQUIRED` deleted from core/config.py (+ IRIS_ARCH/IRIS_CONFIG_MAP updated, 2 stale tests replaced). **RD-003 closed** (`/home/pi/iris_sleep.log` does not exist; removed from ROADMAP).
- **Deployed (md5 repo=RAM=SD, all 8):** assistant.py=`db96f785b796b9a61bed0b591f6fe5d8`, hardware/audio_io.py=`035d43b6d7e623f959354a9938110c5a`, hardware/base_mount_bridge.py=`9ba56cbb0862c11d2b28823700c4d2ad`, core/intent_router.py=`692c8e17b5340c0336bb1ade476ef1e0`, core/config.py=`d9ebc9c5751a2db89af9424b1af7c83f`, iris_web.py=`1fe3acc39ce4f54bc16c0e5621dd51d4`, iris_web.js=`5ffc825a52a53816a79d832cc37fd56e`, iris_web.html=`5925e0afd477917f37a62becba4efd18`.
- **POST after restart: 20/23 PASS, 3 WARN, 0 FAIL → AUTHORIZED**, `[BASE] Teensy 4.0 connected`, `[INFO] Ready.` iris-web restarted and serving the new UI.

## Previous Session Changes (S122 — 2026-06-11)

- **Streaming playback pipeline hardening — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED** (Session 2 of S121 review handoffs). Three fixes:
  - **STOP race fixed.** `play_pcm_stream()` no longer clears `_stop_playback` (entry or exit); it accepts a shared `interrupted` Event. The producer in `assistant.py` owns the flag lifecycle (clear at turn start + turn end) and checks `_stop_playback OR _player_interrupted` per LLM chunk and again after each `synthesize()`. Live harness: STOP at t=2.0s mid-synthesis → dispatch halted in 0.21s, LLM stream abandoned at 2/10 sentences. Also fixes latent inverse bug (stale STOP from idle aborting the next turn's first chunk).
  - **TTS_MAX_CHARS now enforced on the streaming path.** Cumulative dispatched-char counter; at ≥1500 chars dispatch stops and the LLM stream stops being consumed. Live harness: num_predict=2000 story → halted at 1567 chars/15 sentences. `config.py` comment names both enforcement points.
  - **TeensyBridge reader can no longer die silently.** Reader snapshots `_ser` under the lock, except handler uses the snapshot, broad `except Exception` → log + retry. Live harness reproduced the previously-fatal error class (`'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`) → reader logged, reconnected, sends resumed.
- **Deployed files (md5 RAM=SD verified):** `assistant.py`=`e55bbda4a02f971ce6f31398dee01ab9` (now LF on Pi), `hardware/audio_io.py`=`09e6468d7dbce097408001d03890eec8`, `hardware/teensy_bridge.py`=`f662309a45b8aa065dad1f0a40c27f85`, `core/config.py`=`b5d8d57b9e66185d90a56d7b40f606ed`.
- **POST after restart: 19/23 PASS, 4 WARN, 0 FAIL → AUTHORIZED**, `[INFO] Ready.` (WARN delta vs S120 is the no-[VER]-on-restart artifact.)
- **Pending human check:** voice-spoken "stop" through the mic during a LONG reply (interrupt-listener STT path) + immediate next-wakeword acceptance.

## Last Session Changes (S120 — 2026-06-09)

- **Stale-reference sweep, Batch 3 (Pi4 code) — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.** Removed dead `think:False` from the 4 remaining Pi4 Ollama callers (Mistral has no thinking mode) and refreshed their stale qwen3.5 comments:
  - **`pi4/assistant.py`** — `ask_ollama` (chat) + startup warmup. md5 RAM=SD=`2350a4108468a1f687f0eb40b094b0d7`.
  - **`pi4/services/vision.py`** — `ask_vision`; num_ctx 6144 KEPT (image tokens, matches modelfile). md5=`31cb7a089060ce3102c86281ac2936c6`.
  - **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `api_vision`; removed wrong "qwen3.5 thinking model" rationale, num_ctx 6144 KEPT. md5=`077002b46dbc8691cb5b75b5e44b680b`.
  - **`pi4/iris_post.py`** — `l3_llm` POST smoke. md5=`18748f348149590879f8a43b83f83f11`.
- **WebUI:** `pi4/iris_web.html` confirmed 0 gemma/qwen hits (only generic "Vision Model" + config-key labels). No change.
- **Verified live:** `py_compile` clean; assistant + iris-web restarted; POST **20/23 PASS, 0 FAIL → AUTHORIZED**; L3 LLM smoke PASS; `[LLM] Model warmed.`; LLM chat smoke `[EMOTION:NEUTRAL]` + no `[INST]/</s>/User:` bleed; `/api/vision` returned a clean frame description (no HTTP 400, num_ctx intact, no bleed).
- **Flagged (non-behavioral drift):** repo `assistant.py` is CRLF vs live LF; repo `iris_post.py` is Unicode (`→ × ──`)+1 extra comment line vs live ASCII-normalized. Code logic byte-identical; only think:False changed. vision.py/iris_web.py byte-match repo. Future repo↔Pi4 normalization sweep recommended — see HANDOFF Proactive Flags.
- (Batches 1+2 — docs/JSON + tools stale-ref sweep — committed REPO-ONLY earlier this session; see CHANGELOG S120.)

## Last Session Changes (S119 — 2026-06-09)

- **LLM migrated qwen3.5:27b → mistral-small3.2:24b** (iris + iris-kids). Both rebuilt on GandalfAI. arch=`mistral3`, dense, Pixtral vision baked in. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`** — FROM mistral-small3.2:24b. PARAMETER block replaced: num_gpu 99, num_ctx 4096, temperature 0.75, top_p 0.9, repeat_penalty 1.1, stop `[INST]`/`[/INST]`/`</s>`/`User:`. SYSTEM + all few-shot/calibration/VISION blocks preserved verbatim. The `User:` stop was added (beyond brief spec) to kill few-shot turn-bleed Mistral exhibits without Qwen's `<|im_end|>` boundary. DEPLOYED.
- **`ollama/iris-kids_modelfile.txt`** — same FROM + PARAMETER block + stop set. Kids persona preserved. DEPLOYED.
- **`pi4/services/llm.py`** — removed `"think": False` from `stream_ollama()` payload (Mistral has no thinking mode; was dead weight from S114 qwen3.5). md5 RAM=SD=`911261166ce7aeed07a8e3ef1a2d044e`. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. assistant.service restarted, POST L1 iris+iris-kids PASS, live path emits correct emotion tags with zero `[INST]/</s>/User:` bleed.
- **Gates:** PT-001 15/20 (persona-locked, no RLHF tells; cleaner than gemma3; `goodnight→NEUTRAL` and `motor/servo` now pass; remaining misses are borderline/fixture-debatable). Latency: text 35.8 tok/s, vision 100% GPU, warm 1.4s, cold 12s (vs 29s qwen3.5).
- **Housekeeping:** stray root files (`$null`, `Update-IRISProjectFiles.*`) swept to `_housekeeping/S119_root_sweep/` with MANIFEST; `LICENSE` restored (was an unstaged deletion).
- **S119b:** num_ctx unified 4096→6144 on both modelfiles + GandalfAI rebuild (vision cold-after-text 12.4s→2.4s, no reload; VRAM 15GB at 6144, 100% GPU). No Pi4 change needed (vision.py already sent 6144; text callers inherit the new default).
- **NOT done (follow-up):** `think:False` still present in 4 other Pi4 callers (assistant.py, vision.py, iris_web.py, iris_post.py) — harmless dead weight on Mistral, sweep next session. Live voice (wakeword→TTS) and camera-vision human checks pending. Repo-wide stale-reference sweep (old model names in docs/WebUI) recommended as its own session — see HANDOFF.

## Last Session Changes (S118 — 2026-06-09)

- **Vision 400 fixed.** Web UI "describe what you see" returned `400 Bad Request` from `/api/generate`. Root cause: a real camera frame = ~4570 vision tokens > the model's default 4096 `num_ctx` (`"exceeds the available context size"`). NOT a vision-support issue — iris has the `vision` capability. Broke both web UI and voice paths since the S113/S114 qwen2.5vl→qwen3.5 swap.
- **`pi4/services/vision.py`** — `ask_vision()` adds `"options": {"num_ctx": 6144}`. md5=`1e5500958db39e888db4bb4294150b9d` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED.
- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `api_vision()` adds `"think": False` (was missing → empty reply on thinking model) + `"options": {"num_ctx": cfg.get("VISION_NUM_CTX", 6144)}`. md5=`9f7af3a6d023edd794cb067abdff3871` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED.
- **VERIFIED:** `POST /api/vision` → HTTP 200 in ~29 s with a correct scene description. (~29 s is inflated by an Ollama model reload — vision's 6144 ctx differs from the 4096 text default; see Proactive Flags.)

## Previous Session Changes (S117 — 2026-06-09)

- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — Response-length tiers retuned for a voice robot (were narrator-length). `num_predict` SHORT 120→40 (~9s), MEDIUM 350→90 (~21s), LONG 700→180 (~41s), MAX 1200→400 (~92s≈1.5min), default 300→100. `TTS_MAX_CHARS` 2500→1500 (~100s hard backstop, all tiers). Basis: measured ~0.23s speech/token (S116). Inline rationale+rollback in file. md5=`5391ed8c079dee4527c72ec8e148237f` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`pi4/services/llm.py`** — `_MAX_PATTERNS` now triggers MAX (story tier) ONLY on explicit "tell me a story"/essay/long-form requests; removed the `word_count>15` LONG→MAX promotion so wordy "explain…" stays LONG. md5=`b94427979460d21805765f817b8cf522` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED (live: story→400, explain→180, history→180, essay→400, hello→40).

## Previous Session Changes (S116 — 2026-06-09)

- **`pi4/hardware/audio_io.py`** — New `play_pcm_stream()`: gapless back-to-back playback of a queue of per-sentence PCM blobs with one EYES:SPEAKING/mouth-anim/interrupt-listener spanning the whole utterance. `play_pcm`/`play_pcm_speaking` untouched. md5=`ada50cfc3ab6b8ae52efdc7c7f9aab9c` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED.
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — Main LLM block rewired: `stream_ollama()` → per-sentence `synthesize()` → background `play_pcm_stream` player. First audio now starts on the first sentence (was: full response synthesized in one blocking call). STOP checked per sentence dispatch. Emotion-on-first-chunk, Piper fallback, length classifier, follow-up loop all preserved. md5=`fe79c67bd5dfea50f5559e0304d37c35` RAM=SD. DEPLOYED.
- **Latency (LLM-start→first-audio, n=10 long prompts):** NEW p50=2086ms / p90=4257ms vs OLD (blocking) p50≈23.3s on these long replies. Resolves S98 streaming flag. Behavioral hardware checks (speaker/emotion-face/spoken-STOP/Piper) need a human — handed off.

## Previous Session Changes (S115 — 2026-06-09)

- **`pi4/core/intent_router.py`** — `_TIME_RE` pattern: added `what time is it` explicit literal + `time please` variant. "what time is it" now routes to UTILITY (was falling through to LLM at ~1434ms). md5=ea9e0d82425f76d98053c2b71221ef99 RAM=SD. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`** — Adversarial few-shot "You're dumb." example: `[EMOTION:ANGRY]` → `[EMOTION:AMUSED]`. Old ANGRY example was overriding S112 EMOTION CALIBRATION block. iris rebuilt on GandalfAI. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **VAD** — `SILENCE_SECS=1.2` confirmed in iris_config.json. No change needed.

## Previous Session Changes (S114 — 2026-06-09)

- **GandalfAI Ollama** — Already at 0.30.7 (no upgrade needed). GPU dispatch confirmed for qwen3.5:27b: 35.2 tok/s VERIFIED.
- **`ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`** — Removed `PARAMETER think false` (unsupported in Ollama 0.30.7; causes `ollama create` error). `"think": false` moved to API call level. iris rebuilt on GandalfAI. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`ollama/iris-kids_modelfile.txt`** — Same removal. iris-kids rebuilt. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — `"think": False` added to `ask_ollama()` and warmup call. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. md5=1c42e3dd707281eaacc2cb2380394743 RAM=SD.
- **`pi4/services/llm.py`** — `"think": False` added to `stream_ollama()` payload. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. md5=e93c69c2430415826baeaf05e247c853 RAM=SD.
- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — `VISION_MODEL` changed from `"qwen2.5vl:32b-q4_K_M"` → `"iris"` (qwen3.5:27b handles vision natively). DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. md5=f7a143d855a06c9b3fb8292e58ef363c RAM=SD.
- **`pi4/iris_post.py`** — `"think": False` added to l3_llm POST test. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. md5=2bf0723a7f06d8f72896f3178af0e8ec RAM=SD.
- **`pi4/services/vision.py`** — `"think": False` added to ask_vision() /api/generate call. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. md5=a60ffceaa8364678d2dffd04cbb951fc RAM=SD.
- **`tools/workbench/workbench.js`** — `"think": false` added to both /api/generate calls in harness + latency tester. REPO-ONLY.
- **Pi4 POST** — 20/23 PASS, WARN: 3, FAIL: 0 (was 19/23, FAIL: 1 on LLM smoke). All FAIL resolved.
