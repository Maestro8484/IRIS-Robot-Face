Entries are in chronological order, oldest first. Active and forward-looking items are in `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## Batch 1A — Runtime Survival

**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Harden wakeword runtime survival. Prevent OpenWakeWord failures from crashing or hanging the assistant.

Implemented:
- OpenWakeWord startup retry/backoff.
- Runtime restart if OpenWakeWord process dies.
- Wakeword socket timeout.
- Wakeword failures return `"error"` instead of hanging silently.
- Main loop skips STT/LLM/TTS when wakeword error occurs.

Deployed, persisted, committed, and pushed.

---

## Batch 1B — Sleep/Wake Authority

**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Centralize and harden sleep/wake state handling.

Implemented:
- Canonical `_do_sleep()` and `_do_wake()`.
- Unified sleep/wake entry paths in assistant command listener and wakeword-during-sleep path.
- `/tmp/iris_sleep_mode` synchronized with runtime state.
- `send_command()` and `send_emotion()` return bool status.
- Web sleep/wake routes update mouth intensity.
- `iris_wake.py` clears `/tmp/iris_sleep_mode`.

---

## S35 — Wakeword Baseline Restoration

**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Restore `hey_jarvis` as the stable production baseline after failed custom wakeword experiments.

Background: Two custom wakewords were trained and tested — `hey_der_iris` and `real_quick_iris`. Both failed real-world reliability testing in a live household environment and were abandoned. Neither should be redeployed without new household voice samples, clean process restart, and one-model-at-a-time testing.

Rules established (permanent):
- Do not deploy `hey_der_iris` or `real_quick_iris` without new voice samples and explicit user approval.
- Do not test both custom wakewords simultaneously.
- Preserve scripts and notes as experimental history only.
- Confirm live Pi4 state before any future wakeword deployment.

---

## Batch 1C — Reliability Hygiene

**Status:** Complete — all items done or explicitly deferred/closed

Implemented:
- Config validation/coercion for `iris_config.json`.
- Graceful volume subprocess failure handling.
- TTS hard-cap fallback at sentence boundary.
- `mkstemp()` replacing unsafe `mktemp()` in `vision.py`.
- Rate-limited malformed JSON stream warning in `llm.py`.
- Dynamic response-length classification: SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG/MAX tiers.
- SPEAKER_VOLUME persistence: web UI volume API calls `alsactl store` and writes `SPEAKER_VOLUME` to `iris_config.json` on every change.

Deferred/closed items:
- Route sleep wakeword greeting through Wyoming Piper — DEFERRED/CLOSED. Kokoro is primary; local Piper binary broken but not worth fixing.

---

## S36 — Suspend Eye Movement During TTS

**Status:** Complete (commit c27517a)

Implemented:
- `src/main.cpp`: Eye movement paused for duration of TTS audio playback, resumed on completion.

---

## S37 / Batch 3-A — Persona Framing + Temperature

**Status:** Complete (commit 8bdf87e)

Implemented:
- `ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`: Replaced explicit EMOTIONAL STATE AND EXPRESSION block with implicit thick-skin/fast-mouth character framing.
- Temperature raised from 0.7 to 0.82.
- iris model rebuilt on GandalfAI. Smoke tests passed.

---

## S38 / Batch 3-B — Kokoro TTS

**Status:** Complete

Implemented:
- Kokoro TTS (Docker, GandalfAI port 8004) replaces Chatterbox as primary TTS.
- Piper (Wyoming port 10200) retained as fallback.
- Chatterbox retained as rollback reference only — not actively used.

---

## S39 / Batch 3-C + 3-D — Model Upgrade + Full Persona Pass

**Status:** Complete

Implemented:
- Batch 3-C: gemma3:12b replaced by gemma3:27b-it-qat on GandalfAI.
- Batch 3-D: Full persona pass — AMUSED tag added to modelfile valid-values line, vocal texture added, insult examples added, contradiction fix applied.
- Standing rule established: IRIS is male. Pronouns: he/him. The name sounds female but is not. Applies to all modelfile edits, persona descriptions, and handoff docs.
- iris model rebuilt on GandalfAI.

---

## S40 / Batch 3-E — Vision Prompt

**Status:** Complete

Implemented:
- Vision prompt behavior configured in `ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`.

---

## S42 / Batch 3-F — Pre-LLM Intent Router

**Status:** Complete

Implemented:
- `pi4/core/intent_router.py` — NEW. 5-layer REFLEX/COMMAND/UTILITY/AMBIGUOUS/LLM classifier. Fail-open on exception.
- `pi4/assistant.py` — single `router.classify()` gate replaces all scattered inline checks.
- `ollama/iris_modelfile.txt` — NEVER say forbidden phrase block appended to SYSTEM.
- GandalfAI — `git pull` + `ollama create iris` run. Live validation: 4/5 pass.

---

## S43 — Spoken Numbers Fix

**Status:** Complete

Implemented:
- `pi4/services/tts.py` — `spoken_numbers()` / `_int_to_words()` extended to handle thousands (< 1M) and millions (< 1B). Removed `<= 999` bailout in catch-all regex. "4210" → "four thousand two hundred ten".
- Deployed and persisted to Pi4 (md5 verified).

Standing rule established: LLM personality drift → check GandalfAI model sync first (`ollama show iris --modelfile` vs repo). Three-way desync is possible: SuperMaster / GitHub / GandalfAI running model.

---

## S44 — RANDOM_NUMBER Handler + Follow-up Filter + Web UI Logs

**Status:** Complete (commit 35d01ba, 2026-04-28)

Implemented:
- `pi4/core/intent_router.py` — `RANDOM_NUMBER` utility handler added to Layer 2. Catches "pick/tell/give/choose/generate a random number" with optional "between X and Y" range. Answered locally via `random.randint` — zero LLM latency.
- `pi4/assistant.py` — Follow-up loop `< 3 words` gate removed. Replaced with `_WHISPER_HALLUCINATIONS` set check. Brief valid replies ("Yes, 54.", "No.", "Seven.") now pass through correctly.
- `pi4/services/llm.py` — Random-number phrases added to `_SHORT_PATTERNS` as LLM-path fallback tier.
- `pi4/iris_web.py` — `/api/logs` appends last 40 lines of `iris_intent.log` so web UI Logs tab shows per-request routing decisions.

---

## S45 — Batch A Docs Cleanup

**Status:** Complete (commit 13c1461, 2026-05-02)

Batch A docs-only cleanup. No code changes, no deploys, no Pi4 or GandalfAI changes. Seven files updated.

- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — Chatterbox→Kokoro primary throughout; Batch 1C marked Complete; gemma3:27b-it-qat in repo structure; "as of S45" label; reboot checklist updated; Chatterbox section relabeled rollback reference.
- **`README.md`** — Teensy 4.1 (was 4.0); 7-eye table corrected (EYE:0–6, dragon at 5, bigBlue at 6; leopard/snake noted pending compile); gemma3:27b-it-qat; PROG button note removed (enclosure-mounted); mouth driver corrected to KurtE/ILI9341_t3n hardware SPI2.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — GandalfAI role updated: Kokoro primary, Piper fallback, Chatterbox rollback only; VRAM numbers updated to Kokoro+gemma3:27b-it-qat baseline.
- **`SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`** — Updated to S45; Piper routing + Volume persistence removed from active issues; AMUSED gap added as HIGH active issue.
- **`HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`** — Batch 1C marked fully closed; SPEAKER_VOLUME marked DONE; ACK/NACK removed from Batch 2; AMUSED removal added as tracked Batch D task.
- **`docs/iris_issue_log.md`** — SPEAKER_VOLUME marked Fixed; Piper routing updated to Deferred/Closed.
- **`IRIS_CONFIG_MAP.md`** — num_ctx VRAM note updated: Chatterbox→Kokoro, headroom numbers corrected.
- **`docs/iris_issue_log.md`** (commit 103cbcc) — Created. Append-only structured log of all issues/fixes S1–S44, backfilled from git history.

## Unlabeled session — 2026-05-02 ~20:48–23:18 (RD-001 STOP phrase gate + doc restructure)

**Status:** DEPLOYED to Pi4. No session number was assigned.

**Commits:** `279adb9`, `b00dea9`, `54d576c`, `50b4e52` (retroactively documented S49)

Note: doc commits `279adb9` and `b00dea9` landed ~70 minutes before the code commit `54d576c`. This session had no session close report.

- **`279adb9`** — docs: split IRIS handoff, roadmap, snapshot, and changelog into separate files.
- **`b00dea9`** — docs: organize audits and wakeword import plan.
- **`54d576c`** — `pi4/assistant.py` — `STOP_PHRASES` gate added to main loop after Whisper transcript normalization, before router/hallucination handling. Boundary-aware matching (exact match or phrase-followed-by-space). Avoids false matches on "stopwatch", "quietly", "cancelled". Deployed and persisted to Pi4 (md5 verified). Does not fix Whisper hallucination of "stop" into unrelated text — pre-STT intercept is a future task (RD-001).
- **`50b4e52`** — Update handoff for RD-001 deploy.

---

## S46 — WoL Acknowledgement Beep

**Status:** DEPLOYED+VERIFIED (commit 08c7b60, 2026-05-03)

Session boundary note: commit `abfdb7c` carries an S46 label but its message reads "pre-RD-002 state commit". It was made ~2.5 hours after the S46 deploy and describes setup for S47 (RD-002). The S46 label on that commit is an artifact — its content belongs to S47 prep.

Implemented:
- `pi4/assistant.py` — `play_wol_beep()` added. `ensure_gandalf_up()` gains optional `pa=None` parameter. Ascending 2-tone beep (660 Hz → 880 Hz, ~360 ms) plays on Pi4 speakers when WoL packet is sent and GandalfAI is offline. No beep when GandalfAI is already up.
- `pi4/hardware/audio_io.py` — beep implementation.
- Deployed and persisted to Pi4 (md5 verified). assistant.py restarted — `[INFO] Ready.` confirmed.

---

## S47 — RD-002 AMUSED Emotion Full Implementation

**Status:** FULLY DEPLOYED (2026-05-03). Pi4: config.py, led.py, iris_web.html — md5 verified, assistant active. Teensy 4.1: firmware flashed by user. GandalfAI: iris-kids model rebuilt. Pending: live behavior verification.

**Commits:** `734149a` (implementation, 2026-05-03), `287938d` (docs: add status terminology rule — S47 close activity, committed without S47 label)

**Goal:** Fully implement AMUSED as a first-class emotion across the IRIS stack. Decision changed from removal (prior doc guidance) to full implementation. AMUSED = dry amusement at teasing, insults, or attempts to rattle IRIS — distinct from CONFUSED (genuinely unclear/contradictory input).

Implemented:
- `pi4/core/config.py` — AMUSED added to VALID_EMOTIONS and MOUTH_MAP (→ index 2, reuses CURIOUS/smirk expression). LLM emitting [EMOTION:AMUSED] now passes validation and routes correctly instead of falling back to NEUTRAL.
- `pi4/hardware/led.py` — AMUSED: sinusoidal breathe, amber [255,160,0], floor=10, peak=80, period=1.5s, gamma=1.8, duration=3s. Handled as a special case in show_emotion() (not via _EMOTION_LED dict). Livelier than HAPPY/CURIOUS; distinct from ANGRY.
- `src/main.cpp` — AMUSED added to EmotionID enum (value 8, before EMOTION_COUNT). EmotionParams: {0.55f, false, 3000} — medium pupil, no blink, 3s gaze (dry, steady). AMUSED case added to parseEmotion. Falls to default else branch in applyEmotion — no eye swap, uses default eyes.
- `pi4/iris_web.html` — AMUSED button added to Emotion Test grid.
- PlatformIO build: SUCCESS.
- Python syntax check: OK.
- `ollama/iris_modelfile.txt` — no change; AMUSED already present and correctly described.
- `ollama/iris-kids_modelfile.txt` — AMUSED added to valid emotion list.

---

## S48 — NUM_PREDICT Removal + PT-001 Few-Shot Adversarial Examples

**Status:** Task 1 DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. Task 2 REPO-ONLY.

Implemented:
- **Pi4 `iris_config.json`** — `NUM_PREDICT: 200` key removed. SD persisted (md5 verified). assistant.py restarted — `[INFO] Ready.` Tiered classifier (SHORT=120, MEDIUM=350, LONG=700, MAX=1200) now controls LLM response length.
- **`ollama/iris_modelfile.txt`** — PT-001: 8 few-shot adversarial examples added (insults, identity challenges, NEUTRAL deflections). Inserted after ANGRY emotion rule, before NEVER say block.

Both models rebuilt on GandalfAI. PT-001 DEPLOYED.

---

## S49 — Web UI Rework

**Status:** DEPLOYED to Pi4 (commit `6509cca`, 2026-05-06). Pending: live verification in browser.

Implemented:
- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `/api/generate` renamed to `/api/chat` (fixed 404 on all chat sends). `api_chat()` now calls `extract_emotion_from_reply()` + `clean_llm_reply()` before TTS — emotion tags and markdown no longer spoken aloud. New `/api/speak` endpoint for verbatim TTS (bypasses LLM). `/api/logs` rewritten to return structured `{events: [...]}` JSON with category, timestamp, message, detail fields.
- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — Log tab: raw journalctl dump replaced with categorized event panel + filter bar (All / Wakeword / Heard / Route / LLM / Spoken / STOP / Drift / Errors). Chat tab: verbatim speak mode added. Emotion tag displayed inline. TTS conflict warning note added.

---

## S50 — Perceived Latency Hardening + Observability + Kokoro Speed Control

**Status:** DEPLOYED (commit `bae8da0`, 2026-05-18). Pi4 live, md5 verified, assistant restarted — `[INFO] Ready.` confirmed. Pending: user voice verification + manual post-deploy steps (KOKORO_SPEED dial-in, SILENCE_SECS, OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE on GandalfAI).

Goal: Add configurable Kokoro speed, complete bench timing instrumentation, long-retention JSONL bench log, journald retention bump, and intent log retention bump.

Implemented:
- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — `KOKORO_SPEED = 1.0` added; registered in `_OVERRIDABLE` and `_TYPE_COERCE` (float, 0.5–2.0). Web UI can set speed without assistant restart.
- **`pi4/services/tts.py`** — `_synthesize_kokoro()` lazy-imports `KOKORO_SPEED` per call and passes `"speed": KOKORO_SPEED` to Kokoro-FastAPI payload. Re-read on every TTS call — no restart needed after web UI change.
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — `_bench_write()` helper added. Every turn (REFLEX/COMMAND/UTILITY/LLM) that reaches `play_pcm_speaking` now appends one JSON record to `/home/pi/logs/iris_bench.jsonl`. New bench stages: `wake_to_record_start_ms`, `record_duration_ms`, `router_ms`, `play_start_ms`, `total_ms`, `gandalf_was_cold`, `model`. All existing `[BENCH]` lines supplemented with new `_ms` fields; engine label corrected from "chatterbox" → "kokoro". All bench logging wrapped in try/except.
- **`pi4/core/intent_router.py`** — `backupCount` bumped from 7 to 365 days.
- **`pi4/etc/journald.iris.conf`** (new) — `SystemMaxUse=500M`, `MaxRetentionSec=1year`.
- **`pi4/scripts/install_journald.sh`** (new) — Copies conf to `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/iris.conf` and restarts journald. Must be run once after deploy and persisted via overlayfs.
- **`IRIS_CONFIG_MAP.md`** — `KOKORO_SPEED` row added to Kokoro table.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — RD-007 stub added (bench trend viewer in iris_web).

## S51 — Intent Router Regex Hardening

**Status:** DEPLOYED (2026-05-18). Pi4 live, md5 `184e38ae685ce03f00e05cf29b3c0adf` verified at both `/home/pi/core/intent_router.py` and `/media/root-rw/overlay/home/pi/core/intent_router.py`. assistant.py restarted — service active.

**Goal:** Fix 4 false positives in `intent_router.py` identified in `review/findings_session_4_router.md` (Opus 4.7 audit). Primary fix: `_DATE_RE` false positive routing historical year questions to the date handler.

**Changes to `pi4/core/intent_router.py`:**

1. **`_TIME_RE` tightened** — Negative lookahead blocks `(did|was|were|happened)` after `what time` and `what hour`. Also blocks `current time travel`.
2. **`_DATE_RE` tightened** (primary fix) — Negative lookahead blocks `(did|was|were|happened|built|born|died|founded|invented|started|ended)` after `what (year|month|day|date)`. "What year did the Civil War end?" now routes to LLM; "What year is it?" still routes to DATE.
3. **`_KIDS_OFF_RE` tightened** — Removed bare `adult mode` and `normal mode` alternatives (too generic; matched casual speech with no kids-mode intent).
4. **`_random_number_reply`** — `digit` keyword now returns 0–9 range instead of 1–100.
5. **`_layer2_utility` RANDOM_NUMBER** — `payload={"result": reply.rstrip(".")}` added; result now logged in intent log.

**Findings applied:** 4.5 (MED: _DATE_RE historical false positive), 4.7 (LOW: KIDS_OFF bare adult/normal mode), 4.9 (LOW: random number log missing result), 4.10 (LOW: digit range).
**Findings not applied:** 4.6 (volume patterns — too risky without live testing), 4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4/4.8 (out of scope).

**Deploy note:** sftp_write truncates overlayfs writes to `/home/pi/core/` directly. Workaround: sftp_write base64 to `/tmp/` then `mv`. Both `/home/pi/core/` and `/media/root-rw/overlay/home/pi/core/` are the same inode — no separate SD copy step needed after `mv`.

---

## S52 — Web UI: KOKORO_SPEED Slider, Chat TTS Kokoro Force, Vision Demo Panel

**Status:** DEPLOYED (2026-05-18). Pi4 live, md5 verified (`iris_web.py` `59115bdda6f063faffde1f7593f54c61`, `iris_web.html` `e1ddf120dc8d0667544eda105d9cf1ec`), iris-web restarted — Flask serving on 0.0.0.0:5000 confirmed.

**Goal:** Three Web UI improvements — KOKORO_SPEED slider in Voice tab, Kokoro TTS force in chat (bypassing stale module-level import), Vision Demo panel with /api/vision endpoint.

**Changes to `pi4/iris_web.py`:**

- `_speak_worker` rewritten to call Kokoro API directly from live `cfg` dict (`KOKORO_VOICE` + `KOKORO_SPEED`). Piper fallback retained. Root cause fixed: previous code imported `KOKORO_ENABLED` at module level — stale constant caused all chat TTS to fall back to Piper.
- `/api/vision` endpoint added: libcamera-still capture → base64 → Ollama `/api/generate` with `images` field → emotion strip + clean → optional Kokoro speak. Uses `VISION_MODEL` from live cfg.

**Changes to `pi4/iris_web.html`:**

- Voice tab: `KOKORO_SPEED` slider field added (0.5–2.0, step 0.05). Kokoro Web UI link fixed (`/web` suffix). `saveKokoroSettings()` now includes KOKORO_SPEED in the POST to `/api/config`.
- Chat tab: Vision Demo card added — 5 preset prompts, custom input, Kokoro speak toggle, calls `/api/vision`.

**Also this session:** Removed approval gate from `CLAUDE.md` (pre-flight summary + wait-for-confirmation steps eliminated). Commit `bda42c9` pushed.

---

## S53 — Bench Tab: 20-Cycle History, To First Word Column, Expanded Headers

**Status:** DEPLOYED (2026-05-19). Pi4 live, md5 verified (`iris_web.py` `5fc8b075e52bf0dd4bc26f39e507f3dc`, `iris_web.html` `7d3a63f629a5195085a753e93b541cff`), iris-web restarted — Flask serving on 0.0.0.0:5000 confirmed.

**Goal:** Four Bench tab improvements — history depth, new latency column, readable column headers, usability polish.

**Changes to `pi4/iris_web.py`:**
- `api_bench`: cycle limit changed from `[-25:]` to `[-20:]`.

**Changes to `pi4/iris_web.html`:**
- History table now retains and displays last 20 cycles (was 25).
- New column "To First Word": `dur_total − dur_audio` = wakeword to speaker start. Inserted between Playback and End-to-End. Color coded green/amber/red (< 4s / 4–7s / > 7s).
- All 14 column headers expanded to plain English: `trig`→Trigger, `np`→Token Limit, `rec`→Recording, `stt`→Transcription, `ttfc`→1st LLM Chunk, `llm`→LLM Stream, `tts`→TTS Synth, `aud`→Playback, `TOTAL`→End-to-End, `eval/prompt`→Tokens (Eval/Prompt).
- Hint paragraph rewritten to match new column names.
- Transcript column: snippet length 22→45 chars, `min-width:200px / max-width:360px`, full text in `title` tooltip on hover.
- Trigger column: `.slice(0,6)` removed — full trigger name displayed.
- All five `colspan="14"` references updated to `15`.

## S54 — RD-008: Mouth TFT Visual Overhaul (BL curve, idle animations, Pi4 dimming)

**Status:** Firmware REPO-ONLY (A+B+C) — flash pending. Pi4 (D) DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.

**Commits:** `4e7c61b` (firmware A+B+C), `bd6598b` (Pi4 D).

### Sub-task A: Backlight PWM log curve

- Replaced linear map (`level*17`) with `BL_MAP[16]` lookup in `mouth_tft.cpp`.
- Curve: `{0,2,4,7,11,16,22,30,40,55,75,100,135,175,210,255}` — low end compressed.
- intensity 0=off, 1=2/255 (nearly dark), 8=40/255 (comfortable), 15=255.
- All four `analogWrite(MOUTH_TFT_BL)` call sites converted. `_currentBLLevel` tracks live state.

### Sub-task B: Mouth bitmap colors

- Colors already implemented in prior session — confirmed correct per spec.
- Added `MTFT_AMBER=0xFD20` constant (reserved for AMUSED; currently reuses CURIOUS smirk index 2).
- Fixed stale comment: BL pin is GPIO 5.

### Sub-task C: Idle animations (Teensy)

Six animations: BREATHE (45s BL sine), DRIFT (20s subtle pulse), TWITCH (smirk 400ms), BLINK (BL-off 150ms), YAWN (surprised oval 600ms + BL bump), SIDESMIRK (smirk 800ms + BL bump).
All millis()-based, no delay(). Interrupted immediately by mouthIdleStop().
IDLE:START / IDLE:STOP serial commands. Auto-start after 120s inactivity.
`mouthIdleTick()` called each non-sleep loop() iteration.

### Sub-task D: Pi4 idle dimming (DEPLOYED)

- `config.py`: `MOUTH_INTENSITY_IDLE=3`, overridable via iris_config.json (int, 0-15).
- `assistant.py`: wakeword → send MOUTH_INTENSITY_AWAKE; end of LLM+TTS+followup → send MOUTH_INTENSITY_IDLE.
- Pi4 md5 verified (config `535d62b3`, assistant `259dd0a1`). SD persisted. Assistant running.

**Remaining:** Flash firmware via PlatformIO upload. Dark-room verify: sleep=dark, idle=dim, wakeword=bright, post-speech=dim.

## servo-pico Pico W update (2026-05-20)

- I2C pins fixed for Pico W: `Wire.setSDA(6)` + `Wire.setSCL(7)` before `Wire.begin()` in setup().
- TTP223B capacitive touch toggle added on GPIO 15 (physical pin 20): single tap enables/disables servo tracking. `servoEnabled` starts `false` (tracking off at boot).
- `sysmap.json` servo_pico section updated: hardware=Pico W, source path corrected, GPIO 14/15 added, tunable constants current.

## Pico W servo-pico overhaul (2026-05-20)

- Switched from Mbed core to Earle Philhower RP2040 core — fixes Wire.setSDA/setSCL and ServoEasing compatibility.
- Removed tilt servo (pan only).
- Added TTP223B touch toggle on GPIO 15 (servo enable/disable, starts disabled).
- I2C explicit pin assignment: Wire.setSDA(6), Wire.setSCL(7) for Pico W.
- Sketch moved to IRIS-BaseServoControlViaPerson_Sensor/ subdir (Arduino IDE requirement).
- Pico W successfully reflashed bare board via BOOTSEL, COM10.
- HW-002 partially resolved: BOOTSEL accessible on bare board. Enclosure wiring (RUN pin, switch) deferred to PCB rewiring.
- RD-009 planned: WiFi touch integration (volume, TTS interrupt, wakeword). Full spec in review/HANDOFF_PICO_WIFI_TOUCH.md.

## Servo Controller Hardware Evolution — Pico W → ESP32 → Teensy 4.0 (S56–S59)

**Summary:** The servo base mount controller went through two board replacements before reaching its current state.

- **Pico W** — Original servo controller. Firmware developed with Earle Philhower RP2040 core + ServoEasing. Had USB enumeration hardware failure (S56) — no USB detected on any port.
- **ESP32 DevKit 1C** (S57) — First replacement board. Firmware rewritten for ESP32 (servo_esp32/ directory). PCB was destroyed during enclosure work (S58) — board tombstoned. servo_esp32/ directory removed.
- **Teensy 4.0** (S58) — Final replacement. Firmware renamed to `servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`. ServoEasing library retained. USB to Pi4 at `/dev/ttyACM1`, later `/dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO` (S63 udev symlinks). DEPLOYED+VERIFIED S59.

Current servo controller is Teensy 4.0. ESP32 and Pico W are tombstoned. All HW-002/RD-009/RD-010/RD-011 roadmap items referencing ESP32 closed (removed from ROADMAP S68 docs pass).

## S61 — Event Log Persistence + Gesture Monitoring (2026-05-23)

**Status:** DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. Commits `8ee2519` (S61) + `5af1073` (S61b). All 4 files md5-confirmed RAM=SD. iris-web restarted, /api/logs returning 82 events from SD history on first load.

**Goal:** Ensure all IRIS events survive Pi4 reboots and are reviewable in the web UI. Add a gesture monitoring interface in the Gestures tab. 100MB log retention ("forever or 100MB").

**Root causes fixed:**
1. `_MSG_RE` regex wrong — was `assistant|iris.web`, actual journald format is `python3[PID]`. Event log was silently dropping all events (showed nothing).
2. Cron overwrite bug — `iris_log_export.sh` used `> file` (overwrite) + `--boot`. As journald rotated, each cron run replaced the SD file with progressively fewer events, destroying history. Fixed: append mode + timestamp tracking.
3. Cron interval too slow — was `*/15`, changed to `*/5` (must beat ~35-min journald rotation window).

**Changes:**
- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — Fixed `_MSG_RE`. Module-level `_parse_event_msg()` + `_sd_events(n_days=3650)`. `/api/logs` merges journalctl + all SD daily logs (deduped, capped 500). Added `[GESTURE]` + legacy `[BASE]` gesture parsing. New `/api/gesture_log` endpoint (200-event gesture history from SD+journal). md5 `0561d413`.
- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — `cat-gesture` CSS, `f-gesture` filter. Gesture filter button in Logs tab. Gesture Event Log card in Gestures tab (auto-refresh 30s, date+time display, 300px). md5 `84531409`.
- **`pi4/hardware/base_mount_bridge.py`** — Gesture output changed to structured `[GESTURE] gesture={line} action={action}` (was `[BASE] {line}`). Connection/error messages remain `[BASE]`. md5 `30f3e04b`.
- **`pi4/scripts/iris_log_export.sh`** — Rewritten: append mode, timestamp tracking (`/run/iris_log_last_ts`), 100MB size-cap (oldest daily files removed). md5 `47b0959e`.
- **`pi4/scripts/iris-logs.cron`** — Updated `*/15` → `*/5`. `/etc/cron.d/iris-logs` updated on Pi4.

## S61b — GandalfAI Log Backup + SLEEP/WAKE Gesture Actions (2026-05-23)

**Status:** DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. All files md5-confirmed RAM=SD.

**Goal:** Persist IRIS logs to GandalfAI (permanent LAN workstation backup). Add SLEEP/WAKE as assignable gesture actions.

**Changes:**
- **`pi4/scripts/iris_log_export.sh`** — Added scp block: copies all daily logs to `gandalf@192.168.1.3:C:/IRIS/iris-logs/` using `/home/pi/.ssh/id_iris_logs` (ed25519, BatchMode). Runs every 5 min with existing cron. md5 `5fe88e7d`.
- **`pi4/hardware/base_mount_bridge.py`** — Added SLEEP and WAKE dispatch cases: send `EYES:SLEEP`/`EYES:WAKE` UDP to CMD_PORT 10500. These trigger the full `_do_sleep()`/`_do_wake()` sequences in assistant.py (starfield eyes, snore mouth, LED dim, /tmp/iris_sleep_mode). md5 `dc944097`.
- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — SLEEP/WAKE added to `_GESTURE_ACTIONS` + `_GESTURE_LABELS`. Gesture Event Log hint updated to reference GandalfAI backup. md5 `d1c15589`.
- **GandalfAI setup** — `C:\IRIS\iris-logs\` directory created. `C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys` configured with pi4-iris-logs public key (Windows OpenSSH admin override). icacls: SYSTEM:F + Administrators:F, no inheritance. 7 daily log files confirmed on GandalfAI.
- **Pi4 SSH key** — ed25519 at `/home/pi/.ssh/id_iris_logs` + `/media/root-ro/home/pi/.ssh/id_iris_logs`. SD-persisted across reboots.

## S62 — Sleep Animation Enhancement (2026-05-24)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY. src/main.cpp, mouth_tft.cpp, sleep_renderer.h changed locally. Teensy 4.1 firmware flash pending (user PlatformIO upload, env:eyes, COM7). Pi4 SLEEP_CFG_MAP deployed but Teensy firmware does not yet handle SLEEP_CFG: commands.

**Goal:** Enhance Teensy 4.1 sleep animation — amplified starfield, crescent moon glow, Earth planet, warp streaks. Add SLEEP_CFG: serial command so Pi4 can tune animation parameters without reflash.

**Changes:**
- **`src/sleep_renderer.h`** — Amplified star brightness, crescent moon glow, Earth-like planet, warp streaks animation.
- **`src/mouth_tft.cpp`** — mouthSleepFrame() enhanced.
- **`src/main.cpp`** — SLEEP_CFG: command handler added (parses key=val, updates animation params).
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — SLEEP_CFG_MAP dict + updated _do_sleep() to push SLEEP_CFG: params on sleep entry. Deployed to Pi4 during S62. Local commit pending.

## S63 — WebUI→Teensy Fix + Persistent USB Device Identity (2026-05-25)

**Status:** DEPLOYED (udev rules + config.py + CMD listener auto-wake). Local repo sync complete. Commit pending.

**Goal:** Fix webUI buttons (emotion, eye select, mouth) having no effect on Teensy 4.1 displays. Prevent recurrence via hardware-identity-based USB device naming.

**Root causes:**
1. **USB port swap** — Teensy 4.0 and 4.1 were physically connected to swapped Pi4 USB ports. Linux `/dev/ttyACM*` assignment is port-position-based. Swapping ports meant Teensy 4.1 was on `/dev/ttyACM1` (assigned to base mount) and Teensy 4.0 was on `/dev/ttyACM0` (assigned to eyes). All eye/mouth commands went to the wrong device.
2. **Sleep mode display bypass** — Even after fixing the port swap, EMOTION:/EYE:/MOUTH: commands arrived via CMD listener while `eyesSleeping=true`. Teensy firmware processes these in `processSerial()` but `loop()` returns early when sleeping — the eye engine and mouth TFT never render. Commands silently succeeded at the serial level but produced no visual output. APA LEDs responded because they are driven from Pi4 Python directly, not through the sleep early-return.

**Changes:**
- **`pi4/scripts/99-iris-teensy.rules`** (NEW) — udev rules binding `/dev/ttyIRIS_EYES` to Teensy 4.1 (USB serial 13625440) and `/dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO` to Teensy 4.0 (USB serial 12763490). Survive all port swaps and reboots. DEPLOYED to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-iris-teensy.rules` + udevadm reload.
- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — `TEENSY_PORT = "/dev/ttyIRIS_EYES"`, `BASE_MOUNT_PORT = "/dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO"`. DEPLOYED+VERIFIED.
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — CMD listener: auto-wake added (if `state.eyes_sleeping` and EMOTION:/EYE:/MOUTH: command arrives, `_do_wake()` fires before forwarding). Also synced SLEEP_CFG_MAP + updated _do_sleep() + BaseMountBridge leds arg from deployed S62 state (S62 had deployed these without local commit). CMD listener patch DEPLOYED; full file sync REPO-ONLY.
- **`docs/sysmap.json`** — `serial.device` → `/dev/ttyIRIS_EYES`, `pico_serial` replaced with `teensy40_serial` + `udev_rules` section, `servo_pico` node renamed `teensy40` with correct hardware/source/GPIO.
- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — USB Device Identity section added. All `/dev/ttyACM*` references updated. Hard rule added: never hardcode `/dev/ttyACM*` in code, config, or commands.

## S65 — Cosmic Sleep Animation Overhaul + Web UI Sliders (2026-05-25)

**Status:** Firmware FLASHED (Teensy 4.1, env:eyes, COM7). Pi4 files REPO-ONLY — iris_web.html, iris_web.py, config.py pending DEPLOY.

**Goal:** Rebuild Teensy 4.1 sleep animation to visually match HTML v8 mockup (Saturn+Moon+warp particles+nebula+3-wave mouth+symmetric ZZZ). Add SLEEP_CFG: serial protocol so Pi4 can push 24 animation parameters to Teensy on each sleep entry without reflash. Wire all parameters to live web UI sliders in a new Sleep Animation card.

**Changes:**

- **`src/sleep_cfg.h`** (NEW) — Shared struct header: `SleepCfg` (25 fields: speed, starCount, starBrightMin/Max/TwinkleAmp, shootCount/Speed/Len/Bright, warpCount/Speed/Bright, moonR/Drift, saturnR/Drift, nebulaAlpha, waveAmp0/1/2, waveOscAmp, mouthPulseAlpha, zzzAlpha0/1/2) + `extern SleepCfg sleepCfg`. Solves GC9A01A_t3n.h / ILI9341 header conflict — mouth_tft.cpp includes only this header.

- **`src/sleep_renderer.h`** (FULL REWRITE v3) — Cosmic animation: Saturn with back/front ring scanlines (ellipse math, tilt=0.42, 4 colors), Moon with crescent+glow, 48 warp particles (LFSR-seeded angles/speeds, radial outward motion), starfield (twinkle), nebula overlay. ZZZ removed from eyes (moved to mouth per v8 spec). SR_FRAME_MS=155ms (~6.4fps). Moon top-right/left; Saturn bottom-left/right. `SleepCfg sleepCfg = {.speed=0.85, ...}` defined here (single TU via main.cpp).

- **`src/mouth_tft.cpp`** — `mouthSleepFrame()` fully rewritten: clear ZZZ zone (fillRect 0,4,320,67), draw 3 symmetric Z-pairs per side (6 Z total, sinusoidal Y drift, cyan from sleepCfg.zzzAlpha*), 3-wave band y=76..162 (blue 0x001F, purple 0x780F, teal 0x0318; primary+0.35x secondary at 1.7x freq matching v8 formula). cy oscillation capped ±14px for SWSPI band constraint.

- **`src/main.cpp`** — `SERIAL_BUF_SIZE` 32→40 (accommodates longest SLEEP_CFG: token). Added `SLEEP_CFG:` handler in `processSerial()`: splits on `=`, maps all 24 SleepCfg field names to struct members.

- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — 24 `SLEEP_ANIM_*` constants added with defaults matching v8 spec (speed=0.85, warpCount=12, moonR=28, saturnR=22, etc.). All added to `_OVERRIDABLE` set and `_TYPE_COERCE` dict with type + slider range bounds.

- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `_SLEEP_CFG_KEYS` dict (short name → SLEEP_ANIM_* config key). `/api/sleep_cfg` GET: returns 24 current values keyed by short name. POST: maps short keys to SLEEP_ANIM_* and writes via `write_cfg()`.

- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — Sleep Animation card with 4 `<details>` groups (Stars & Warps, Shooting Stars, Objects, Mouth), 24 sliders. `_buildSaSliders(data)` renders all sliders dynamically. `_saCfgSend(key,val)` debounced 180ms POST to `/api/sleep_cfg`. `_loadSaSliders()` fires GET on first Sleep tab open. Sleep nav button wired: `tab('sleep',this);_saTabHook()`.

**Animation speed:** SR_FRAME_MS=155ms (was 130ms), `speed` default 0.85 (was 1.0). ~17% overall slowdown per user request.

## S66 — IRIS Power-On Self-Test (POST) (2026-05-25)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — Pi4 files pending DEPLOY.

**Goal:** Add a comprehensive 5-layer startup diagnostic that runs automatically at boot and on demand via web UI or SSH. Surfaces hardware faults, service outages, and config drift before any user interaction.

**Changes:**

- **`pi4/iris_post.py`** (NEW) — 5-layer POST sequence implemented as `_POST` class + `run_post(leds, teensy, pa, verbose)` public API. L0: serial /dev/ttyIRIS_EYES open + EMOTION:NEUTRAL, mic wm8960 PyAudio open, rpicam-still test capture, gesture sensor I2C 0x73 smbus probe (WARN or FAIL per GESTURE_SENSOR_REQUIRED). L1: GandalfAI TCP check + WoL if unreachable (polls 5s/120s), Kokoro/Whisper/Piper/OWW TCP connect with retry, Ollama /api/tags model list. L2: MOUTH:0-8 cycle (400ms dwell), EMOTION sweep, EYES:SLEEP/WAKE, EYE index cycle, MOUTH_INTENSITY ramp — all via UDP 10500. L3: intent router "what time is it" → assert ROUTE_UTILITY, Kokoro TTS round-trip, Ollama LLM smoke (model=iris, prompt="hello"), intent log writable check. L4: iris_config.json JSON parse + unknown-key audit vs _OVERRIDABLE, assistant.py RAM vs SD md5, iris_config.json owner pi:pi check. L5 verdict: AUTHORIZED if 0 FAILs, else TTS alert + LED red flash 3×. Log path: /home/pi/logs/iris_post.log. Standalone SSH: `python3 /home/pi/iris_post.py` exits 0/1 by verdict.

- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — `GESTURE_SENSOR_REQUIRED = False` added to Hardware section. Not in _OVERRIDABLE (deploy action, not web UI tunable). Flip to True after PAJ7620U2 I2C swap is confirmed on live hardware.

- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — `run_post(leds=leds, teensy=teensy, pa=pa)` called after OWW starts, before main `while True:` loop. On FAIL verdict: prints blocked message + `sys.exit(1)`. Import wrapped in try/except so a missing iris_post.py does not crash startup.

- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `/api/post` GET/POST route. POST: starts `run_post()` in daemon thread (single concurrent run enforced by `_post_running` Event), returns `{"ok":true,"started":true}` immediately. GET: returns `{"running":bool,"result":<last result dict>}`. Module-level `_post_last_result` holds last completed result.

- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — POST diagnostic card added to System tab (before Config Persistence card). "Run POST Diagnostic" button + status indicator. On trigger: polls `/api/post` GET every 2s. On completion: renders per-check result table (Layer / Check / Result / Detail) with color-coded PASS/WARN/FAIL. `runPost()`, `_pollPost()`, `_renderPostResult()` JS functions added.

---

## S67 — iris_bench.jsonl SD Persistence (2026-05-27)

**Status:** DEPLOYED+VERIFIED

**Goal:** Persist bench log across reboots by appending RAM records to SD layer on each 15-min cron cycle.

**Changes:**

- **`pi4/scripts/iris_log_export.sh`** — Extended with byte-offset append block. On each cron run (as root), new records from RAM `/home/pi/logs/iris_bench.jsonl` are appended to SD `/media/root-ro/home/pi/logs/iris_bench.jsonl` using `/run/iris_bench_last_pos` stamp. Stamp resets on boot — each boot cycle appends its own records.
- **`pi4/core/config.py`** — `BENCH_LOG` (RAM write path) and `SD_BENCH_LOG` (SD accumulation path) constants added.
- **`pi4/assistant.py`** — `_bench_write` uses `BENCH_LOG` constant instead of hardcoded string.
- **`install_journald.sh`** — Run on Pi4. journald retention extended to 500MB / 1 year (S50 pending step completed).

All Pi4 files DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. Commit pushed.

---

## S68 — Docs Audit + Servo Subsystem Documentation (2026-05-27)

**Status:** Complete (docs-only)

**Goal:** Audit and correct all documentation to reflect confirmed hardware state after S59-S67 changes. Document Teensy 4.0 servo subsystem fully in preparation for PAJ7620U2 firmware work.

**Changes:**

- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — System Roles and Architecture tables enhanced for Teensy 4.0. T4.0 pin section adds firmware file, ServoEasing, autonomy behavior, and power-toggle notes. Serial Protocol section extended with Teensy 4.0 one-way serial. Repo Structure and Env Quick Ref updated. PAJ7620U2 pending hardware section added. Stale `/dev/ttyACM0` reference corrected.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — HW-002/RD-009/RD-010/RD-011 (ESP32 tombstoned items) removed. HW-001 closed. HW-003 (PAJ7620U2 swap) added.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Servo controller evolution history added (Pico → Pico W → ESP32 → Teensy 4.0).
- Memory files corrected: flash workflow memories updated to Teensy 4.1; `project_servo_controller_hardware.md` created.
- SNAPSHOT/HANDOFF updated to reflect confirmed state.

Commit cf0b17b pushed.

## S69 — PAJ7620U2 Driver + DS3218MG Constants (2026-05-27)

**Status:** FLASHED — Teensy 4.0 firmware flashed. Hardware install pending (PAJ7620U2 not yet wired to I2C bus). Touch3 is pin 15 (T3 pad on Teensy PCB) — no external component.

**Goal:** Replace dead APDS-9960 gesture sensor with PAJ7620U2 bare I2C driver. Tune servo constants for DS3218MG. Add touch3 LISTEN trigger to replace removed proximity channel. Add mount-orientation abstraction.

**Firmware changes (servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino) — commits 35ffaf3 → bf304a8:**

APDS-9960 removed entirely: SparkFun include, apdsOk flag, raw 0x39 ID probe, PROX_LISTEN_THRESHOLD/PROX_HOLD_MS, prox LISTEN logic.

PAJ7620U2 bare I2C driver added:
- `paj_write(reg, val)` / `paj_read(reg)` I2C helpers
- `paj7620Init()` — wakeup sequence (any I2C contact, 700ms settle, ACK confirm), bank 0 (29 reg writes via 0xEF=0x00), bank 1 (20 writes via 0xEF=0x01), back to bank 0, unmask all gestures (0x41=0xFF), gesture mode (0x42=0x01); returns bool
- `pollGesture()` — reads register 0x43 (IntFlag_1) each loop; non-zero = gesture; dispatches via GEST_* macros

Register 0x43 correct bit layout (PAJ7620U2 datasheet v1.5 p.24 — confirmed before wiring):
- Bit 0 (0x01) = Left, Bit 1 (0x02) = Right, Bit 2 (0x04) = Down, Bit 3 (0x08) = Up
- Bit 4 (0x10) = Forward, Bit 5 (0x20) = Backward, Bit 6 (0x40) = CW, Bit 7 (0x80) = CCW

Mount orientation abstraction (`#define GESTURE_MOUNT_DEGREES`):
- Values 0/90/180/270 each compile to the correct GEST_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT macro mapping
- `#error` fires at compile time for any other value
- **Current setting: 270** (sensor mounted 90° CCW relative to viewer)
- 270° mapping: phys UP=0x01, phys DOWN=0x02, phys LEFT=0x04, phys RIGHT=0x08

Command dispatch: phys UP→`VOL+`, phys DOWN→`VOL-`, phys LEFT or RIGHT→`STOP`; Forward/Backward/CW/CCW ignored

Touch3 LISTEN: `pollTouch3()` on pin 15 (T3 cap pad), `TOUCH3_THRESH=1500`, `TOUCH3_HOLD_MS=1000`. Short tap (release <1s) → `STOP`; hold ≥1s → `LISTEN`. Replaces proximity-LISTEN from removed APDS-9960.

SERIAL_DIAG hardening: CODEX DIAGNOSTIC INSERT wrappers on all diagnostic blocks; pajOk printed in periodic telemetry (`pan=N pajOk=1`); raw gest byte printed on gesture detect; touch3 raw value printed each second for TOUCH3_THRESH tuning.

DS3218MG constants: PAN_SPEED 0.02 (was 0.04), PAN_DEAD_ZONE 5.0 (was 2.0), FACE_RETURN_MS 6000 (was 8000).

Serial contract unchanged: VOL+/VOL-/STOP/LISTEN (no Pi4 side changes required).

**Other changes:**
- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/platformio.ini`** — Removed stale SparkFun APDS9960 lib_deps comment. Platform URL auto-updated by PlatformIO.
- **`servo_teensy40/README.md`** — Hardware list updated (PAJ7620U2 0x73, DS3218MG, touch3 pin 15, /dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO). Stale "new firmware to be written" note removed.
- **`docs/sysmap.json`** (local-only, gitignored) — Full S69 patch set: teensy40.role, gpio pin table (pin 15 touch3 added, pins 18/19 updated), PAJ7620U2 sensor block with register 0x43 bit table + rotation table for all 4 mount angles, GESTURE_MOUNT_DEGREES reference, TOUCH3_PIN/TOUCH3_THRESH/TOUCH3_HOLD_MS constants, servo field, _meta updated.
- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — Architecture table Teensy 4.0 row updated (PAJ7620U2, touch3). Teensy 4.0 pin section rewritten: pin 15 added, I2C devices updated, serial command table adds LISTEN, PAJ7620U2 quick-reference section added with reg 0x43 bit table + rotation table for all 4 mount angles + command mapping. "Pending Hardware — PAJ7620U2" section removed. Repo Structure .ino comment updated. Serial Protocol Teensy 4.0 block updated (APDS-9960→PAJ7620U2, LISTEN added).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — CHANGELOG same-session enforcement rule added to Documentation rules and Hard Rules sections.
- **`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_PAJ7620U2_DS3218MG.md`** — Session handoff doc committed to repo.
- **`docs/sysmap_patch_2026-05-27.md`** — Patch spec committed for reference.

**Build fix — `touchRead` not implemented in PlatformIO Teensy 4.x framework:**
PlatformIO `framework-arduinoteensy` declares `touchRead()` in `cores/teensy4/core_pins.h` but provides no implementation for Teensy 4.x (implementation only exists in `cores/teensy3/touch.c`). Resulted in linker error: `undefined reference to 'touchRead'`. Fix: added `capTouch(pin)` in the .ino — ADC discharge-float-sample approach (drive LOW, float INPUT_DISABLE, sample ADC). Returns 0–1023 (10-bit). TOUCH3_THRESH updated from 1500 to 100 to match ADC scale. SERIAL_DIAG prints raw capTouch value for threshold tuning.

Commits: 35ffaf3 (initial driver), f31e6ce (SERIAL_DIAG hardening), cb26e7e (reg 0x43 bit map + rotation fix), bf304a8 (GESTURE_MOUNT_DEGREES abstraction), b0f6bcc (doc update: IRIS_ARCH.md, platformio.ini, SNAPSHOT, HANDOFF, CHANGELOG), + touchRead build fix commit.

## S70 — ServoEasing Async Smoothing + PAN_MIN/MAX + PAN? Query (2026-05-28)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — build clean, pending user PlatformIO upload (env:teensy40).

**Goal:** Replace synchronous panServo.write() with ServoEasing interrupt-driven async API, add hard rotation limits, add PAN? angle query command.

**File changed:** `servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`

**Changes:**

1. **Constants block** — `PAN_MIN 45.0` and `PAN_MAX 135.0` added after `FACE_RETURN_MS`. All `constrain()` calls updated from hardcoded `0.0/180.0` to `PAN_MIN/PAN_MAX`.

2. **setup()** — Easing type set once: `panServo.setEasingType(EASE_CUBIC_IN_OUT)`. Interrupt mode enabled: `enableServoEasingInterrupt()`. Initial `write()` cast removed (float arg now passed directly). `setUpdateInterval(20)` omitted — not present in ServoEasing 3.6.0 (library resolved to 3.6.0 from `^3.3.3`); 20ms is the library default (`REFRESH_INTERVAL = 20000µs`).

3. **loop() — tracking branch** — `panServo.setEasingType(EASE_CUBIC_OUT)` removed. `panServo.write((int)desiredPan)` replaced with `if (!panServo.isMoving()) { panServo.startEaseToD(desiredPan, 100); }`.

4. **loop() — return-to-center branch** — `panServo.setEasingType(EASE_SINE_OUT)` removed. `panServo.write((int)desiredPan)` replaced with `if (!panServo.isMoving()) { panServo.startEaseToD(desiredPan, 100); }`.

5. **PAN command handler (SERIAL_DIAG)** — `toInt()` → `toFloat()`, limits updated to `PAN_MIN/PAN_MAX`, `write((int)desiredPan)` → `startEaseToD(desiredPan, 100)` (no isMoving guard — direct command always takes effect).

6. **PAN? query command (SERIAL_DIAG)** — new branch: `cmd == "PAN?"` → `Serial.print("PAN="); Serial.println(panServo.getCurrentAngle());`. Returns live servo position as float.

**Build:** Clean — `pio run -e teensy40` SUCCESS. FLASH/RAM well within Teensy 4.0 limits.

---

## S71 — Servo Docs Update: DS3218MG Confirmed Installed (2026-05-28)

**Status:** Complete (docs-only)

**Goal:** Update documentation to reflect DS3218MG servo confirmed physically installed and operational. Correct stale ServoEasing notes in wiring doc (still referenced old synchronous API). Fix `touchRead` → `capTouch` in IRIS_ARCH.md pin table (S69 build fix never propagated to docs).

**Changes:**

- **`docs/servo_teensy40_wiring.md`** — Servo Control Notes section rewritten: `EASE_CUBIC_OUT tracking / EASE_SINE_OUT return` replaced with S70 API (EASE_CUBIC_IN_OUT, `startEaseToD(target, 100)`, `isMoving()` guard, FACE_RETURN_MS 6000ms). PAN_MIN 45° / PAN_MAX 135° clamp range documented. Last-updated timestamp updated.
- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — Pin 15 table row: `touchRead(15)` corrected to `capTouch(15)` with note that `touchRead` is not implemented in Teensy 4.x PlatformIO framework.
- **`servo_teensy40/README.md`** — Status line updated: "Firmware current as of S69" → DS3218MG confirmed installed and operational, firmware current as of S70.

## S72 — PAJ7620U2 Full Gesture Expansion + DS3218MG MS24 + Web UI Update (2026-05-28)

**Status:** Pi4 files DEPLOYED+VERIFIED. Firmware REPO-ONLY (pending user flash).

**Goal:** Wire all 8 PAJ7620U2 gesture types to firmware + bridge + web UI. Add MUTE action. Correct servo model to DS3218MG MS24. Fix gesture event log inversion. Update all hardware mapping docs.

**Changes:**

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`** — `pollGesture()` emit block extended: FORWARD (0x10), BACKWARD (0x20), CW (0x40), CCW (0x80) now emit `Serial.println()` strings (previously silently ignored). File header comment updated to list all 8 commands. REPO-ONLY pending user flash.

- **`pi4/hardware/base_mount_bridge.py`** — `_DEFAULT_GESTURE_MAP` extended: FORWARD→LISTEN, BACKWARD→SLEEP, CW→VOL+, CCW→VOL-. `_mute_restore` module-level state added. `MUTE` action added to `_dispatch()`: toggles between vol=0 and saved restore level using `get_volume`/`set_volume` from `hardware.audio_io`.

- **`pi4/iris_web.py`** — `_BASE_GEST_RE` updated to match FORWARD/BACKWARD/CW/CCW in legacy `[BASE]` log lines. `_DEFAULT_GESTURE_MAP` extended (4 new keys). `_VALID_GESTURE_ACTIONS` extended: SLEEP, WAKE, MUTE added. `api_gesture_config()` GET: now merges stored GESTURE_MAP with defaults so new gesture keys always appear with sensible defaults even if `iris_config.json` was written before S72.

- **`pi4/iris_web.html`** — Gestures card: APDS-9960/ttyACM1 stale refs → PAJ7620U2/ttyIRIS_SERVO; LISTEN label corrected (was "proximity hold" → "touch3 hold, pin 15"); proximity threshold slider removed (APDS-9960 specific); FORWARD/BACKWARD/CW/CCW select rows added with divider. `_GESTURE_KEYS` extended (8 total). `_GESTURE_ACTIONS` extended: MUTE added; SLEEP/WAKE labels shortened. `loadGestureConfig`: proximity threshold DOM refs removed. `saveGestureConfig`: GESTURE_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD removed from POST body. `fetchGestureLog`: empty-state hint updated (PAJ7620U2); `box.scrollTop=0` replaced with `window.requestAnimationFrame(() => box.scrollTop=0)` to guarantee paint-after-reset for reliable newest-at-top behavior.

- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — Serial command table: 4 new rows (FORWARD/BACKWARD/CW/CCW with default actions). "command mapping" section: FORWARD/BACKWARD/CW/CCW described. Serial protocol block: all 8 commands listed. Pin 2 row: servo model updated to Miuzei DS3218MG MS24.

- **`servo_teensy40/README.md`** — Servo model updated to DS3218MG MS24; shared I2C bus with Person Sensor noted.

- **`docs/servo_teensy40_wiring.md`** — Servo model row updated to DS3218MG MS24.

- **`docs/sysmap.json`** (local-only, gitignored) — `serial_commands` updated (8 commands). `servo` field: MS24 added. `gpio` pin 2/15 rows corrected (MS24, capTouch note). `command_map`: all 8 gestures documented with default actions and note on configurability. `tunable_constants`: PAN_MIN/PAN_MAX added; EASING_TRACK/EASING_RETURN replaced with EASING_TYPE/EASING_MOVE_MS (S70 async API).

**Deploy fix — `BaseMountBridge.__init__` signature mismatch:**
Live `assistant.py` calls `BaseMountBridge(_bm_cfg, leds)` (two positional args). S72 `base_mount_bridge.py` `__init__` only accepted `(self, config)`. Fixed by adding `leds=None` parameter. Pi4 RAM and SD updated; md5 verified. Services restarted: assistant POST 21/22 PASS AUTHORIZED, iris-web active.

**Pi4 deploy — md5 verified (RAM = SD):**
- `/home/pi/hardware/base_mount_bridge.py` — a69b1a7c (leds=None fix included)
- `/home/pi/iris_web.py` — 575eabecc5
- `/home/pi/iris_web.html` — d95f9c6461

## TS40-S2 — PAJ7620U2 Gesture Debounce + Cooldown State Machine (2026-05-29)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — firmware pending user PlatformIO flash (env:teensy40).

**Goal:** Eliminate the 3-5× repeat-fire problem where one hand swipe emits multiple gesture commands. Each physical gesture should fire exactly once.

**Changes:**

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/paj7620.h`** — NEW FILE. Extracts PAJ7620U2 public interface from `.ino` (TS40-S1 refactor + TS40-S2 debounce in one session). Exports: `PAJ7620_ADDR`, `GESTURE_MOUNT_DEGREES`, `GESTURE_DEBOUNCE_MS` (400), `GESTURE_COOLDOWN_MS` (200), `SERIAL_DIAG`, `extern bool pajOk`, `paj7620Init()`, `pollGesture()`.

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/paj7620.cpp`** — NEW FILE. All PAJ7620U2 driver code: `paj_write`, `paj_read`, `paj7620Init`, `pollGesture` with debounce state machine. Debounce logic in `pollGesture()`: (1) first-poll discard — reads and drops reg 0x43 on first call after init (PAJ7620U2 stale-data hardware behavior); (2) global cooldown — any gesture within `GESTURE_COOLDOWN_MS` of the last fired gesture is suppressed; (3) per-gesture debounce — same gesture within `GESTURE_DEBOUNCE_MS` is suppressed. Suppressed gestures emit `DIAG: PAJ7620 gest=0xNN SUPPRESSED debounce|cooldown` when `SERIAL_DIAG=1`. Emit block and command strings unchanged.

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`** — Removed: `SERIAL_DIAG` define, `PAJ7620_ADDR` + `GESTURE_MOUNT_DEGREES` + `GEST_*` rotation table, `bool pajOk`, `paj_write`, `paj_read`, `paj7620Init`, `pollGesture`. Added: `#include "paj7620.h"`. Person Sensor, servo, and touch3 code untouched.

- **`docs/sysmap.json`** — `tunable_constants`: `GESTURE_DEBOUNCE_MS` (400) and `GESTURE_COOLDOWN_MS` (200) added with notes.

**Rollback:** `git checkout -- servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino && rm servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/paj7620.h servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/paj7620.cpp`

## TS40-S1 — Modular Subsystem Extraction + Phantom Touch3 Removal (2026-05-29)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — firmware pending user PlatformIO flash (env:teensy40).

**Note on numbering:** Follows TS40-S2 chronologically. TS40-S2 extracted the PAJ7620U2 gesture driver (`paj7620.h/.cpp`); those files are NOT duplicated or modified here. This session completes the modular split of the remaining inline subsystems and removes dead touch-pad code.

**Goal:** Finish the modular refactor of `teensy40_base_mount.ino` and delete the phantom capacitive touch3 code introduced in S69 for hardware that was never wired.

**Phantom hardware removed (S69 hallucination):** S69 added a capacitive touch pad on pin 15 (T3) with `capTouch()` ADC-discharge sampling, `pollTouch3()`, and `TOUCH3_PIN/THRESH/HOLD_MS` constants. The touch pad was never physically installed. All of it is removed: defines, `capTouch()`, `pollTouch3()` + its SERIAL_DIAG block, the `loop()` call, the build-fix comment about `touchRead()` missing from the PlatformIO Teensy 4.x framework, and the header pin/trigger comments. `LISTEN` is preserved as a valid command/action — it has other invocation paths (FORWARD gesture default action, web UI).

**Modules extracted:**

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/person_sensor.h` / `.cpp`** — NEW. Person Sensor I2C driver: `setupPersonSensor()` (LED-disable register write) and `pollPersonSensor()` returning `PersonResult {ok, faceVisible, faceCenterX, confidence, isFacing}`. Codex-hardened packet decode (header skip, payload/checksum decode, fixed four-face consume, invalid-count rejection, confidence+facing gate) preserved exactly. `ok` field distinguishes a short-read cycle (caller holds pan, matching the original early-return) from a valid no-face read (caller runs idle return). SERIAL_DIAG telemetry preserved.

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/pan_servo.h` / `.cpp`** — NEW. ServoEasing wrapper: `setupPanServo()`, `updatePanFromFace(faceCenterX)`, `updatePanIdle(faceLostMs)`, `handleSerialPanCmd(cmd)` (PAN/PAN?, SERIAL_DIAG-gated). All constants (PAN_SPEED, PAN_DEAD_ZONE, FACE_HOLD_MS, FACE_RETURN_MS, PAN_MIN, PAN_MAX) and `desiredPan` live here. `ServoEasing.hpp` is now included in this one translation unit only.

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/diag.h`** — NEW. `DIAG_PRINT/DIAG_PRINTLN/DIAG_PRINTF` macros gated on `SERIAL_DIAG` (defensive `#ifndef`; canonical define stays in paj7620.h per TS40-S2). paj7620.cpp's existing SERIAL_DIAG usage was intentionally NOT refactored to use diag.h — deferred to a future unify pass.

- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`** — Reduced to orchestration only: `setup()` calls each module's setup + `paj7620Init()`, `loop()` parses REBOOT (delegates PAN/PAN? to `handleSerialPanCmd`), calls `pollGesture()`, then dispatches `pollPersonSensor()` results to `updatePanFromFace`/`updatePanIdle`. Boot I2C presence probe and one-time `I2C_SCAN_DIAG` block retained. **345 lines → 94 lines** (header comment 25 lines; orchestration code ~69). No constant changed; no logic changed apart from touch3 removal. Behavior preserved bit-for-bit (one diagnostic-only nuance: the `pan=` field in the rate-limited PS telemetry now reflects the prior cycle's pan target since the pan update moved to the caller — no functional servo change).

**Docs:**
- **`docs/sysmap.json`** — removed `TOUCH3_PIN/THRESH/THRESH_NOTE/HOLD_MS` from `tunable_constants`, pin 15 from `gpio`, touch3 from `behavior`.
- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — removed pin 15 row, Touch3 section, and touch3 references from System Roles / Architecture / Repo Structure / Serial Protocol. LISTEN retained (gesture action / web UI paths).
- **`servo_teensy40/README.md`** — removed touch3 hardware line; firmware description updated to note modular layout.
- **`.gitignore`** — removed `docs/sysmap.json` from the ignore list. It had been misfiled under "Generated runtime state," but nothing generates it — it is the hand-maintained primary lookup map (PRIMER.md: read before IRIS_ARCH.md). Being ignored excluded it from version history, GitHub backup, and fresh clones. Now tracked. Contains no credentials (IPs only, already present in tracked IRIS_ARCH.md).

**Rollback:** `git checkout -- servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino docs/sysmap.json IRIS_ARCH.md servo_teensy40/README.md && rm servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/person_sensor.h servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/person_sensor.cpp servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/pan_servo.h servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/pan_servo.cpp servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/diag.h`

## HW-004 — PAJ7620U2 Hardware Failure Diagnosis (2026-05-29)

**Status:** BLOCKED — replacement GY-PAJ7620 on order.

**Finding:** PAJ7620U2 gesture sensor confirmed dead. Does not ACK at 0x73 or any valid address (0x13, 0x1B, 0x23, 0x2B, 0x5B, 0x63, 0x6B, 0x73). I2C bus confirmed healthy (Person Sensor at 0x62 responds correctly). VIN=3.3V confirmed with multimeter. SDA/SCL continuity to Teensy pins 18/19 confirmed. Reflow of breakout board header pins attempted — no change. Sensor IC is dead; replacement ordered.

**Diagnostic steps taken:**
- Extended `delay(8000)` boot hold in `setup()` (replacing non-functional `while (!Serial && millis() < 3000)` — Teensy 4.x USB CDC makes `Serial` always truthy, so the original loop was a no-op). Allows serial monitor to connect before boot DIAG lines print.
- Added + used + reverted `I2C_SCAN_DIAG` (full 1–127 address scan 10s after boot). Scan found 0x39, 0x4F, 0x62, 0x79 — all consistent with Person Sensor module internal endpoints + Person Sensor at 0x62. No PAJ7620U2 address present.
- Read PAJ7620U2 datasheet v1.5 sections 5.1.1 (I2C address list) and 6.1.2 (power-on sequence: VBUS before VDD). GY-PAJ7620 5-pin breakout confirmed to tie VBUS internally to VIN — not a wiring issue.
- touch3 idle ADC readings (127–130) confirmed above `TOUCH3_THRESH=100`, causing continuous false LISTEN triggers. Moot — touch3 code fully removed in TS40-S1.

**Changes:**
- **`servo_teensy40/teensy40_base_mount/teensy40_base_mount.ino`** — `delay(8000)` boot hold replacing `while (!Serial && millis() < 3000)` no-op. `I2C_SCAN_DIAG` restored to 0 after use.
- **`SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`** — Teensy 4.0 row updated: HW-004 BLOCKED, sensor dead, replacement on order. Active Issues updated. WHAT'S NEXT gated behind sensor arrival.
- **`HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`** — Next Work pointer updated: BLOCKED on HW-004, sensor replacement steps documented.
- **`docs/iris_issue_log.md`** — HW-004 entry added.

**Next step:** When replacement GY-PAJ7620 arrives, seat identically, confirm `ACK=YES` + `init=OK` at boot, then flash TS40-S1 firmware and verify debounce.

## CODEX SECONDARY-CODER SESSION — 2026-05-29

The following CDX-N entries were produced by ChatGPT Codex 5.5 (extra-high
effort) as a secondary coder during a Claude usage gap. All work is
repo-only. Each CDX-N entry was reviewed by Claude Code on session resume;
the review outcome is noted at the end of each entry.

Codex scope was bounded to: doc audits, consistency passes, test stubs.
No firmware. No live system edits. No protected files. No multi-file
contracts.

## CDX-1 — ROADMAP + Issue Log Audit Pass (2026-05-29)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — documentation audit committed locally.

**Scope:** Audited `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/iris_issue_log.md` against `SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`, `HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and S60 onward `CHANGELOG.md` entries.

**Changes:**
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — Removed resolved or superseded active items: RD-002 (AMUSED emotion full implementation, completed in S47), HW-001 (Teensy 4.1 LED mitigation accepted in S67), and HW-003 (PAJ7620U2 integration superseded by HW-004 dead-sensor tracking). Updated stale active status labels for RD-001, RD-006, and RD-007 without renumbering any identifiers.
- **`docs/iris_issue_log.md`** — Updated stale Status lines only: RD-002 emotion issue now `Fixed`; single-word STT/pre-STT intercept marked `Deferred` to match current active scope; local Piper TTS routing normalized to `Deferred`.

**Review note:** HW-004 remains untouched and BLOCKED on hardware replacement. RD-003 remains Open.

## CDX-3 — sysmap.json + IRIS_ARCH.md Consistency (2026-05-29)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — documentation/map consistency pass committed locally.

**Scope:** Cross-checked `docs/sysmap.json` against `IRIS_ARCH.md`, with spot checks against `SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`, `pi4/core/config.py`, `src/sleep_renderer.h`, and current Teensy 4.0 firmware headers.

**Changes:**
- **`docs/sysmap.json`** — Updated metadata to reflect tracked status (`f740844`), added missing Teensy 4.0 serial commands (`FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`, `CW`, `CCW`) to `commands_from_teensy`, corrected `SR_FRAME_MS` to 155, and removed stale touch1/touch2 behavior entries.
- **`IRIS_ARCH.md`** — Updated Teensy 4.0 serial direction wording to remove stale touch-event reference and list all 8 command strings; corrected repo-structure `SR_FRAME_MS` note to 155; refreshed the `core/config.py` constants block with current ports, Kokoro, serial symlinks, gesture sensor gate, and tiered `NUM_PREDICT_*` constants.

**Mismatch report:**
- MATCH: Pi4/GandalfAI/SuperMaster IPs; `/dev/ttyIRIS_EYES` and `/dev/ttyIRIS_SERVO` symlinks; PAJ7620U2 address `0x73`; Teensy 4.0 pins 2/18/19; PAJ7620U2 register `0x43` bit layout; mount rotation table; gesture command map; PAN_MIN/PAN_MAX; gesture debounce/cooldown.
- MINOR_DRIFT: sysmap stores some values as structured JSON while `IRIS_ARCH.md` presents prose/tables.
- MISSING_IN_SYSMAP fixed: extended Teensy 4.0 `commands_from_teensy` list.
- MISSING_IN_ARCH fixed: current Kokoro/tiered-response/serial-port config constants.
- VALUE_MISMATCH fixed from source/snapshot: `SR_FRAME_MS` 150 -> 155.
- STALE_IN_SYSMAP fixed: tracked/gitignore metadata and touch1/touch2 behavior entries.

**Review note:** No unresolved VALUE_MISMATCH items were auto-resolved beyond values verified in source files and `SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`.

## CDX-4 — README.md Audit: Root + servo_teensy40 (2026-05-29)

**Status:** REPO-ONLY — documentation audit committed locally.

**Scope:** Audited root `README.md` and `servo_teensy40/README.md` against `SNAPSHOT_LATEST.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `IRIS_ARCH.md` system/pin sections.

**Changes:**
- **`README.md`** — Added Teensy 4.0 base mount to project/hardware descriptions; added POST diagnostic, persistent USB identity, and base-mount gesture feature rows; updated GandalfAI TTS wording to Kokoro/Piper; refreshed sleep animation text; added Teensy 4.0 gesture serial block; fixed Web UI "all 9 styles" and "mouth matrix" stale text.
- **`servo_teensy40/README.md`** — Updated firmware status to TS40-S1/TS40-S2, added HW-004 PAJ7620U2 dead/replacement-on-order note, switched wiring reference to `docs/servo_teensy40_wiring.md`, and expanded modular file names.

**Review note:** Root README changelog section was intentionally left unchanged because the separate `CHANGELOG.md` is canonical.
